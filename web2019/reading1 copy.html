	<h2>Lialina's Opinion of the Word "User"</h2>
	<a href="https://canvas.ocadu.ca/courses/30005/discussion_topics/254006">Personal Questions</a>

	

<p>
I think that Lialina’s opinion of the word “user” is that it is not a person, but a part of the computer. She mentioned, “Bloggers, artists, podcasters and even trolls are still users of systems they didn’t program. So, they (we) are all the users. In my opinion what she meant about this, was that no matter what we do now we all become users because it is a part of our every day to day life. Lialina was trying to point out that in order ‘user’ started out as a person, but later they moved away from that. In my opinion I think that a computer is part of our life due to the fact that we use a type of computer all the time. In order for us to separate ourselves from the modern term of ‘users’ we need to find a space where we are not part of the computer making.

	<h3>Ideal Interent User</h3>

<p>
Lialina’s ideal internet user is a person that uses experience design, meaning we use emotions and goals to complete our usage. I think the ideal internet user also needs to be able to protect their rights. She states, “And if we lose this distinction, users may lose their rights and the opportunity to protect them. These rights are to demand better software, the ability “to choose none of the above”, to delete your files, to get your files back, to fail epically and, back to the fundamental one, to see the computer.” I think that once we lose the emotion connection, we no longer have protect ourselves from everything that should be private. We would start sharing everything that we do and there would no longer be a privacy aspect.

	<h4>"Gaps that can be Filled by Users"</h4>
<p>
From my experiences from interacting with the web I think that there are multiple examples were “gaps that can be filled by users”. A main one is that we use the internet for everything and that sometimes we depend too much on it, therefore it sometimes controls us rather than us controlling it. As well, having the computer analyzing every movement that you make by processing the data that you search, makes the border between each closer. Meaning, that you no longer make independent decisions rather that the computer/ web makes them for you.
